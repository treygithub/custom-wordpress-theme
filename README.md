Repo is written by yours truly Rob H. to learn every type of WordPress template in the hierarchy i can think of. Some pages only work on my locale machine, and will not work on your due to naming conventions. Example if you see a file labeled with numbers that was custom ID from my database of post and exct... you will have to change that to yours. But the template for it works great.

HAPPY HACKING....
